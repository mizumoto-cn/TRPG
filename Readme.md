## What is TRPcG

TRPcG is short for "Tiny Remote Procedure-call in Go".

It's a light weight `net/rpc`-based RPC framework which can help people better understand RPC.

- TCP protocol based
- Support for multiple compression formats : gzip, snappy, zlib, etc.
- Implemented protocol buffer. May be cross-platform in future.
- protoc-gen-trpcg plug-in allows you define your own service.
- Support for custom event serialization.

## Structure

TRPcG Client will send request messages, and which will be three parts: an unsigned-int Header Info, a Header, and a Body based on [Protocol Buffers (Google Developers)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial)

Here is a picture of the Request Stream:

![Request Stream](arc/Request.svg)

![Response Stream](arc/Response.svg)

> `uvarint` is just like a variable-length unsigned-integer. It's an encoding of 64-bit unsigned integers into between 1 and 9 bytes.

The **Header** is based on a customized protocol.

**ID** is like a serial code of the RPc call, with which in concurrent cases, clients can determine whether it's a successful call based on the ID serial number of the response.

## Install & Quick Start

- install `protoc` at <https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases>
- install `protoc-gen-go` and `proto-gen`

```bash
go install github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
go install github.com/mizumoto-cn/TRPcG/proto-gen
```

Then you'll need to create a `arith.proto` file to define the rpc services.

Use `protoc` to generate code:

```bash
protoc --trpcg_out=. arith.proto --go_out=. arith.proto
```

Two files will be generated in the directory `message`: `arith.pb.go` and `arith.svr.go`

Then you need a new `main.go` like [main.go.bak](main.go.bak)

After that you can implement your rpc client.

```Golang
...
conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", ":8082")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer conn.Close()
client := TRPcG.NewClient(conn)
...
```

You may also use `AsyncCall` to get a asynchronous return in the form of `*rpc.Call`

You can also use customized compressors like `gzip`, `snappy`, `zlib`, and serializers like json.
